Group Project #2 - Requirements

Welcome to Project 2!

For this planning print, please complete the following tasks and provide the following deliverables by Thurs Feb-14:

- Create a new repo with all teammates added as collaborators

- Add me as a collaborator to your github repo. GitHub user name = bobmchenry . This will allow me to more quickly help you troubleshoot problems and give prompt feedback.

- If you choose to update your wireframes for your project, please do so and note in your submissions that you have updated your wireframes. This is optional.

- Review your user stories from project 1. Please break down any large user stories into smaller tasks.

For example:
As a user I want to add a database record with a form.

Could be:
As a user, I want to be able to enter all of my information for topic X in a form.

AND

As a user, I want to be notified when an invalid entry is entered into a form field

AND

As a user, I want to see my newly added records after they are submitted.

If you follow this paradigm, your one user story that is a large chunk of work is now 3 smaller tasks that combine to accomplish the same goal. They can be completed faster and make it easier to split up the work with teammates.

- Add 10 new user stories to your project. This project will have one more sprint than the last, and since you have all created a LAMP prototype of the project, development should be able to proceed faster. What additional functionality you choose to add to your app is up to you. Note, that completion of all user stories is not required for the project. You can have "nice-to-have" features that you can work on after your core stories for your minimum viable product have been developed.

- Define your minimum viable product. This is a list of user stories that MUST be completed by the end of the project. Carefully review your stories for necessary functionality and define which user stories should be in your mvp. You can add this list of stories to a plain text file called mvp.txt and include it in your repo. There is no hard rules on the number of stories for this, but it should be a reasonable estimate of the minimum amount of work you expect your group to accomplish.

I will meet with your group during class time on 2/14 to review these requirements and provide feedback on your stories and mvp. As mentioned in class, please also try your best to adhere to the git flow workflow, and try to organize a midweek check-in meeting with your group.

To submit, one person from the group should submit a link to the project github repository to notify me that all the sprint 0 work has been completed.
