Group Project #2 - Sprint #0 - Liteweight Fitness Tracker (LFT)

Project Write-Up:  A fitness tracker that allows users to enter data (weight,
calories, activities, body type, etc.), view, manipulate and delete, if
necessary. They can view their progress and results through graphical (charts,
tables, etc.) representation.

User stories:

1  As a user, when I click to add my weight and I click enter,
	then I see a result on a webpage and it will be stored in a
	database

2  As a user, when I click  to convert my weight from kilo to pounds
	or vise versa then I see the results of the conversion

3  As a user, when I click on history graph, then I see a graph
	chart of past history inputs and I can change between data points

4  As a user, when I want to pull history (my daily activities)
	then I click a box to download as a csv file to the browser download

5  As a user, when I enter the wrong information into my activity
	database, then the system will warn me that it is not the correct
	datatype so that my data stays accurate

6  As a user, when I scroll down, I want to see more relevant
	information

7  As a user, when I look at and interact with the page, I expect
	to have a pleasant UX experience, especially with the potential
	for information overload

8  As a user, I can upload an image file (a personal photo, logo
	or quote),then the page will reflect my changes

9  If the user, HOVERS over some element(button, picture, logo etc)
	THEN button changes color/expands/ the pointer changes its look
	to a finger instead of arrow etc other ideas

10  As a user, when I want to invite a friend to use the app,
	then I click the invite button, enter email address and submit

Group Project #2 - Requirements

Welcome to Project 2!

For this planning print, please complete the following tasks and provide the following deliverables by Thurs Feb-14:

- Create a new repo with all teammates added as collaborators

- Add me as a collaborator to your github repo. GitHub user name = bobmchenry . This will allow me to more quickly help you troubleshoot problems and give prompt feedback.

- If you choose to update your wireframes for your project, please do so and note in your submissions that you have updated your wireframes. This is optional.

- Review your user stories from project 1. Please break down any large user stories into smaller tasks.

For example:
As a user I want to add a database record with a form.

Could be:
As a user, I want to be able to enter all of my information for topic X in a form.

AND

As a user, I want to be notified when an invalid entry is entered into a form field

AND

As a user, I want to see my newly added records after they are submitted.
If you follow this paradigm, your one user story that is a large chunk of work is now 3 smaller tasks that combine to accomplish the same goal. They can be completed faster and make it easier to split up the work with teammates.

- Add 10 new user stories to your project. This project will have one more sprint than the last, and since you have all  created a LAMP prototype of the project, development should be able to proceed faster. What additional functionality you choose to add to your app is up to you. Note, that completion of all user stories is not required for the project. You can have "nice-to-have" features that you can work on after your core stories for your minimum viable product (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. have been developed.

- Define your minimum viable product. This is a list of user stories that MUST be completed by the end of the project. Carefully review your stories for necessary functionality and define which user stories should be in your mvp. You can add this list of stories to a plain text file called mvp.txt and include it in your repo. There is no hard rules on the number of stories for this, but it should be a reasonable estimate of the minimum amount of work you expect your group to accomplish.

I will meet with your group during class time on 2/14 to review these requirements and provide feedback on your stories and mvp. As mentioned in class, please also try your best to adhere to the git flow workflow, and try to organize a midweek check-in meeting with your group.

To submit, one person from the group should submit a link to the project github repository to notify me that all the sprint 0 work has been completed.
